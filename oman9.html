                    text: "Elaraâ€™s bakery was not ordinary; her cakes and cookies could grant wishes. To make a wish, you had to eat a treat and wish on a shooting star. One day, a young boy named Milo came in, looking very sad. He wished for his lost toy dinosaur to come home. Elara gave him a stardust cookie. That night, as he ate the cookie, he wished on a bright shooting star. The next morning, his dog, Rex, walked in with the dinosaur in his mouth. Milo was so happy. Elara was happy, too, knowing she brought joy to the boy and his family.",
